        <h2>About Compressify</h2>
        <p>The inspiration for Compressify came from the developer's personal experience with frequently using compression web applications. He often needed to compress images or convert them from one format to another to save storage space and improve upload speeds.</p>
        <p>Large images can significantly slow down websites, leading to a poor user experience due to longer load times. They also consume excessive storage space, which can be costly and inefficient. Furthermore, large image files can reduce overall web application performance, making it crucial to manage and optimize image sizes effectively.</p>
        <p>Compressify aims to address these issues by providing a user-friendly tool that enables users to upload an image directly from their device or via URL, select the desired compression level, compress the image and download the compressed version.</p>
        <p>Compressify helps in optimizing website performance, conserving storage space, and ensuring faster load times.</p>
